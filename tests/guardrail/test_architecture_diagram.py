"""Regenerate the component dependency diagram from the real import graph.

Uses :mod:`grimp` to compute actual module imports, grouped into the components
declared in ``docs/architecture.toml``, and rewrites
``docs/generated/architecture.md``. CI fails if the committed diagram drifts —
so an unexpected cross-component edge shows up as a reviewable diff. The
directional rules are enforced separately by ``test_layering_contract.py``.
