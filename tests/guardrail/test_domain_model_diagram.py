"""Regenerate the domain class diagram from the code (drift-checked in CI).

Rewrites ``docs/generated/domain_model.md`` from the dataclasses declared in the
modules listed under ``[domain]`` in ``docs/architecture.toml``. CI fails if the
committed file changed — i.e. the diagram fell behind the code. Locally run
``make diagrams`` and commit.
