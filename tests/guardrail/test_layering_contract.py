"""Enforce the directional architecture contract via import-linter.

Contracts live in ``pyproject.toml`` under ``[tool.importlinter]``: dependencies
must only point downward (Entrypoints -> Core -> Foundation), expressed as
``forbidden`` contracts. This test runs ``lint-imports`` and fails with its
report if any contract is broken.
