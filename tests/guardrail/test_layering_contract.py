"""Enforce the directional architecture contract.

Python projects: the contracts live in ``pyproject.toml`` under
``[tool.importlinter]`` (dependencies must only point downward,
Entrypoints -> Core -> Foundation, expressed as ``forbidden`` contracts); this
test runs ``lint-imports`` and fails with its report if any contract is broken.

C++ projects (``[project] language = "cpp"``): the same downward-only rule is
asserted directly on the include graph — no component may depend on one in a
higher tier (tier order = declaration order in ``[tiers]``).
